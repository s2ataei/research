# About

This repo contains source code for the methods described in: 

[Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks with Perceptual Loss for Low Dose CT Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14738)

## Usage

DRL contains model and training code for the DRL model using MSE

DRLP contains model and training code for DRL model using Perceptual Loss

`utils.py` contains useful functions for manipulating the [AAPM Low Dose CT Grand Challenge Dataset](https://www.aapm.org/GrandChallenge/LowDoseCT/)
